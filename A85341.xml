            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce, I pre≈øume, you de≈øire an Adver≈øary, who u≈øe the diligence of a publick Challenge to procure one, and that none will think it ≈øtrange, you ≈øhould be ≈øollicited to perform what you have ≈øo ≈øolemnly undertaken; All I have to do, is, in few words, to acquaint my Reader, (who, I think, will ≈øee it rea≈øonable you ≈øhould be oppos'd,) why you are oppos'd by me.</p>
            <p>I am a per≈øon, by the infinite Grace of God, bred up in the Catholick Religion, from which I have learned, my Duty to God cannot be complied with, without an exact performance of my Duty to my Soveraign: To obey him, not for advantage, or temporal concerns, but out of con≈øcience; and becau≈øe ≈øuch is the known will of him, the obedience to who≈øe commands is Religion, has always made a part of mine, being a point, as all other which belong to my Faith, preached by he Apo≈øtles, and from them derived to me by the mini≈øtry of tho≈øe per≈øons his ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred wi≈ødom has appointed to ≈øucceed them.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine in≈øtill'd into my youth by Catechi≈øms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to my riper years by Sermons and Conferences, and po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øing my ≈øoul with ≈øo ≈øetled a beleef, that I did not think any body could pretend to know what Catholick Doctrine is, and not know that this is a part of it, occa≈øioned a ≈øtrange ≈øurprize in me, when Chance ≈øeconding my Curio≈øity, in giving me a fight
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168878:3"/>of your Sermon preached before the Honorable Hou≈øe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>Apr.</hi> 30. 1660. of which I had heard ≈øomthing before, I found in it a plain Challenge, and undertaking to prove again≈øt any Adver≈øary, <hi>That a Papi≈øt mu≈øt cea≈øe to be a Papi≈øt, if he will be truly or fully loyal to his Soveraign.</hi> Had you ≈øaid onely, <hi>Loyalty</hi> were no part of his Religion, and that he performed his Allegiance by the help of ≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>me other Virtue, (though an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Judge would wonder you ≈øhould have better intelligence of their Religion, then them≈øelves, who certainly know, and from the certain knowledge profe≈øs it teaches Loyalty to be a Divine indi≈øpen≈øable Command) the A≈ø≈øertion, however it would have been altogether as fal≈øe, would perhaps have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd not altogether ≈øo exotick. But to deny Loyalty not onely an admittance into, but a con≈øi≈øtence with his Religion, and put an unavoidable nece≈ø≈øity upon him, of being eihter a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to God, by renouncing his Faith, or a Traytor to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, by renouncing his Allegiance, is a Paradox of that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull exce≈øs, that I know not whether is greater, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to a≈ø≈øert, or impo≈ø≈øibility to maintain it. How, Sir, will you undertake to prove, A Catholick mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily de≈øert ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, or his King, who, I think, cannot, I am ≈øure, ≈øhould not be ignorant, that to render what is <hi>Cae≈øars</hi> to <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> does as truly belong to his Religion, as to render what is <hi>Gods</hi> to <hi>God!</hi> That he makes not di≈øtinct Duties of the≈øe, but beleeves his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> is ≈øo much a part of his Obedience to <hi>God;</hi> that the later cannot be perform'd without the former? In fine, you, who, with that ≈øtrong judgment Fame, and I think De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert, gives you to be Ma≈øter of, cannot but ≈øee, were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to intercept the pro≈øpect, that a Papi≈øt, who is not truly loyal, is not truly a Papi≈øt, if the not being faithfully obedient to what is taught by a Religion, make a man cea≈øe to be of it.</p>
            <p>But, as it is not for me, to pry into what it was that mov'd you to a≈ø≈øert this Paradox, ≈øo your care in publi≈øhing it, ≈øuffers none to be ignorant that you have a≈ø≈øerted it, and by doing ≈øo ca≈øt an a≈øper≈øion upon a ≈øort of people, who≈øe try'd Loyalty in all vici≈ø≈øitudes of dangerous troubles, as it ≈øhould have altered your judgment, ≈øo their long and grievous ≈øufferings, whereof their <hi>Loyalty</hi> was one, and perhaps the onely cau≈øe, ≈øhould, from the charity of your profe≈ø≈øion, have found, rather pity for their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168878:3"/>afflictions, then a≈øper≈øions upon their innocence.</p>
            <p>And yet, in the ≈ømall Sphere of my acquaintance, I find very little forwardne≈øs to u≈øe any other defence, then ≈øilent patience, hitherto their onely ≈øhield, again≈øt the many, and heavy blows, which (to borrow the milde≈øt expre≈ø≈øion the conde≈øcendence of charity affords me,) mi≈øtaken Zeal has ≈øo long given their Fames and Fortunes; and a greater di≈øpo≈øition to have recour≈øe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for an increa≈øe of ≈øtrengh, as the blow grows heavier, then to endeavour to lighten the burthen they groan under. But for my part, I mu≈øt confe≈øs the value I ≈øet upon Religion and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, makes me not endure to be deprived of either of them at any rate; and however I may be reconcil'd to all other mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I am not able to bear that of de≈øerving to be mi≈øerable.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, I apprehend ≈øilence in this ca≈øe would amount, or at lea≈øt be mi≈ø-interpreted to a confe≈ø≈øion; and that a Charge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ≈øuch circum≈øtances, would, if not cleer'd, be look'd upon as a Sentence, and the world take it for granted, nothing could be pleaded to it, but Guilty. I know I am <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus inter Tribus I≈ørael,</hi> little known even among tho≈øe of my own Religion; but as loyal as any, and as certain of my Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to be ≈øo. I know al≈øo the concern is general, and greater then to be tru≈øted to any one mans ability, e≈øpecially ≈øuch a one as is truly con≈øcious of his own in≈øufficiency; Neither do I undertake this Demand of Sati≈øfaction vainly, or without ju≈øt occa≈øion offer'd, but as I have my ≈øhare in the injury, I have al≈øo a title to be righted; and; ≈øince no better Champion appears to defend me, think, I both may and ought to defend my ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>In the face of the world therefore, I require you to perform your undertaking, and de≈øire you to reflect, and every body take notice, That if you prove not what you profe≈øs you are ready to do, viz. <hi>That a Papi≈øt mu≈øt cea≈øe to be a Papi≈øt, if he will be truly and fully loyal to his Soveraign,</hi> you are guilty of the breach of charity to your Neighbour, in as great a height as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances can improve a ≈øin to. For to ≈øay nothing of the time, when the joyful and long pray'd for Victory of Right over Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Tyranny fils the Kingdom with comfortable hopes, That the priviledges of Birthright ≈øhall no more be forfeited, but by real and really proved mi≈ødemeanors: to ≈øay nothing of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168878:4"/>the Great Auditory before whom you preacht, per≈øons, of who≈øe wi≈ødom the Nation has given ≈øo ≈øignal a Te≈øtimony, and of who≈øe Coun≈øels his Maje≈øty has expre≈ø≈øed ≈øo tender a regard: Be plea≈øed to con≈øider, 'tis no one you a≈øper≈øe, but many, and tho≈øe, who, of all that lay claim to ≈øo regarded a Title, give the be≈øt evidence of being truly <hi>tender Con≈øciences,</hi> ≈øince for them they ≈øuffer ≈øo generally, ≈øo con≈øtantly, ≈øo deeply. Neither is it a ≈ømall fault you charge them with, but that Mon≈øter of ≈øins, <hi>Trea≈øon,</hi> and that not onely by the violence of pa≈ø≈øion once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but ≈øuch as is impo≈ø≈øible not to be alwaies committed. And all this with ≈øo notorious a publickne≈øs, that none can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of your charge, as I hope none will be ignorant of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>
            <p>Now I be≈øeech you joyn all the≈øe together, and ≈øee (if yours do prove an offence) whether Chance could light upon, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtry contrive greater aggravations. Con≈øider therefore, Sir, what you have done, and what you are to do; and either prove what you have ≈øo ≈øolemnly undertaken, or practi≈øe what you have as ≈øolemnly taught; give an example to the world of that ≈øerious and true <hi>Repentance</hi> you ≈øo excellently delivered to your Auditory. But prove it effectually, and let not the Que≈øtion, when we come to gra≈øp it, vani≈øh away by the artifice of ≈øome deceitful word. You have rai≈øed in the hearts and thoughts of as many as have either heard or read your Sermon, I conceive, an uncharitable, and unju≈øt apprehen≈øion: If it prove ≈øo, I hope the reparation you will make, ≈øhall not be by the fallacy of ≈øome term, to which your Art may perhaps give another ≈øen≈øe, then you have cau≈øed by it in others, to ≈øave your ≈øelf from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making any.</p>
            <p>And yet, to deal plainly, I cannot but be jealous of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions you u≈øe. For why do you call us <hi>Papi≈øts?</hi> You know we have another name, and are not perhaps ≈øuch men as you make us pa≈øs for by that Term: We ow no blind ≈øervile obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any upon earth, that can en≈ønare our Judgments to any thing contrary to tho≈øe Divine Truths brought from Heaven by our Saviour, to bring us up to Heaven, planted by his Apo≈øtles, and pre≈øerved by his Spou≈øe the Church. I pre≈øume you intend by it a Name of Religion, not Opinion; for 'tis the Faith of Chri≈øt I am to lay down my life for, but know no Obligation to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168878:4"/>lo≈øe a Pins head for the fancies of any private man.</p>
            <p>The again what mean you by a <hi>true and full</hi> Loyalty? Tho≈øe Epithetes ≈øeem to me no more then the i≈ø≈øue of a fruitful fancy; ≈øince a Loyalty which is not a true one, is truely no Loyalty: as fal≈øe mony is no mony; and as half a pint is not a pint; ≈øo if any thing want of full Loyalty, how near ≈øoever you approach it is not Loyalty. I do not therefore ≈øee any nece≈ø≈øity of tho≈øe termes; Loyalty in the natural acception of words, ≈øaying both true and full Loyalty: as a ≈øhilling ≈øignifies both Twelve pence and good Silver.</p>
            <p>Under your tearm of <hi>Loyalty</hi> too, I conceive you do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any obligations contradictory to the great one to which all others ought to be ≈øub≈øervient; neither of us being, I hope, guilty of that impious flattery, to imagine any duty can be a duty, which is incon≈øi≈øtent with that fir≈øt and chiefe≈øt duty we owe to our Maker and Pre≈øerver. I be≈øeech you therefore let all the≈øe Terms be defin'd, that the Que≈øtion may not vani≈øh from us in the mi≈øt of the words we u≈øe in treating it. That which I, and I think every one el≈øe, apprehends by your words, is that this Kingdom holds a ≈øort of people, who≈øe Birth-right indeed gives them a title to the Protection of the Laws and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Community, but who≈øe Religion, by mi≈øteaching them in their duty to their King and Country, renders them unworthy of tho≈øe advantages. This is what I apprehend, and what you are to prove.</p>
            <p>Now if you ≈øhould man by <hi>Papi≈øt</hi> ≈øomething which I am not; by <hi>True and Full Loyalty,</hi> ≈øomething which I either do pay, or which none are bound to pay: Your words indeed would be innocent, but the artifice of wre≈øting them to oppo≈øe innocence, little ≈øuitable to your Condition. And that, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire not to be mi≈øtaken in your meaning, none may be ≈øo in my ≈øentiments, I conceive my ≈øelf comprehended in your a≈ø≈øertion, but know no rea≈øon why I ≈øhould de≈øerve the name you expre≈øs it in, more then that I am of the Communion of tho≈øe men who≈øe Faith and Government was taught and in≈øtituted by Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, and by their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors convey'd in an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Delivery down to us. I believe, and what I profe≈øs to you in the face of the world, I am ready by Oath to confirm to all men in the face of heaven, That my Loyalty to my Soveraign
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168878:5"/>is an indi≈øpen≈øable duty from which no power Spiritual, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, Dome≈øtick or Forreign, under any pretence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Depo≈øition, or any other what≈øoever, can free me either wholly or in part; and till I am call'd upon to do it more ≈øolemnly, I here do in the mean time renounce heartily all Di≈øpen≈øations, Ab≈øolutions, and what≈øoever to the contrary which may rai≈øe jealou≈øie in my Soveraign, or di≈ø≈øatisfaction in my fellow Subjects, profe≈ø≈øing that notwith≈øtanding any ≈øuch pretext, if any ≈øhould happen to be, I will by the grace of God, perform my Allegiance truly and fully as every good Subject is bound to do. This is my Religion; this is what I have been taught in It concerning Loyalty; and what the occa≈øion has prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted me to digre≈øs into: ≈øince however the Confe≈ø≈øion I make be impertinent to the bu≈øine≈øs I have in hand (my task being to <hi>oppo≈øe what you ≈øay,</hi> not to ≈øay all I know my ≈øelf) it will not I hope be unwelcome to the Reader, at lea≈øt to ≈øuch an one as de≈øires his judgment ≈øhould be built upon the unmoveable foundation of Truth, of which in things of this nature, there is no greater evidence then the te≈øtimony of ≈øuch as certainly know what they ≈øay, and faithfully ≈øay what they know.</p>
            <p>But to return to our work; I utterly deny your A≈ø≈øertion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øing to all the world tis not true, <hi>That a Papi≈øt mu≈øt cea≈øe to be a Papi≈øt, if he will be truely and fully Loyal to his Soveraign;</hi> and before all the world demand of you to prove it, as you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. If you ≈øhew me di≈øloyal, I acknowledg I ought, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly profe≈øs I will repent: if you cannot, lay your hand on your heart, and con≈øider what tis to make an innocent man, nay, ≈øo many innocent men pa≈øs for guilty, and guilty of ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable a crime as Trea≈øon; in which ca≈øe I hope you will need no admonition to repent your ≈øelf.</p>
